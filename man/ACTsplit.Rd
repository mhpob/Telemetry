\title{Split detections into CSV files according to ACT database}
\usage{
ACTsplit(directory = getwd(), ACTtrans, my.trans = NULL,
  write = TRUE, out = NULL, start = "2000-01-01", end = Sys.Date(),
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{directory}{String passed on to \code{\link{vemsort}}. Location of CSV
data, which defaults to current working directory.}

\item{ACTtrans}{character. Location of ACT transmitter database.}

\item{my.trans}{Numeric vector. Tag ID codes that you want removed prior
to distribution.}

\item{write}{Logical. Do you want to output CSV files? Useful if you are
only looking for unidentified detections.}

\item{out}{String. Where do you want the CSV files placed?}

\item{start}{Character date in a standard unambiguous format
(e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) from which you want to start pulling
detections, assumed to be Eastern time zone. Defaults to Jan 1, 2000.}

\item{end}{Character date in a standard unambiguous format
(e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) to stop pulling detections, assumed to
be Eastern time zone. Defaults to current system date.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments to \code{\link{vemsort}} (parallel? progress bar?)}
}
\value{
Outputs are CSV files in the form of ResearcherCurrentdate.csv and a
   data frame containing detections of unidentified codes. The CSV files
   will be found in your current working directory by default.

\description{
\code{ACTsplit} filters all detections according to the researchers in the
\href{http://www.theactnetwork.com/}{ACT Network}
}
\details{
This function uses \code{\link{vemsort}} to import detections, then matches
these detections with transmitters submitted to ACT. It also allows a
specified date range and removal of personal or private transmitters.

ACTsplit('C:/Users/mypcname/Documents/Vemco/Vue/ReceiverLogs')
# Choose detections from April 1, 2014 up to and including August 1, 2014.
